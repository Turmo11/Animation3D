A few notes about the animations:

- I took as reference (as you said I could) muay thai fighters instead of boxers. Muay thai is a much more frontal martial art than other fighting styles. The fighters don't bounce as in boxing since you can get swiped to the floor. Instead, they go for a stable position where the body weight changes from one leg to the other.

- You will also notice that the step forward and backward only lifts one leg, that is because you want to mantain the stable position so on foot pivots to the new position and the other follows it after.

- There's no jumping in muay thai other than a few jumps to warm up, so I just animated that.
